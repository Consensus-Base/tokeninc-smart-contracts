## Ethereum Smart Contract Architecture

#### Overview



#### Deployment Process

The deployment process is different for the development and production releases of the smart contracts.

###### Development

When developing the smart contracts, this repository uses `truffle develop` local network to deploy, test, and interact with smart contracts.

Truffle has a migration process, `truffle migrate`, which deploys contract sequences using a migration script, located in the `/migrations` folder in the root of this repository.

The default script, `/migrations/1_initial_migration.js`, is used internally by Truffle to keep track of the contracts deployed to the network using a `Migrations.sol` contract. By default, this file should not be altered.

The remaining scripts in the `/migrations` folder are used to deploy the smart contracts in a sequence. The deployment sequence of these contracts is important!

Running the command: `truffle migrate --reset` will deploy the scripts in the sequence corresponding to the pre-fixed number. However, if you need to deploy a specific smart contract, `truffle migrate -f #` is available<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> where `#` is the number of the script to be deployed.

<small>(E.g. `truffle migrate -f 2` is to deploy `2_deploy_contracts.js`)</small>
